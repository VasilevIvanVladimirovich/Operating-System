Coronavirus is a whole family of viruses that includes more than 30 species. The species are grouped into 2 subfamilies. They can infect not only humans, but also animals â€“ cats, dogs, birds, pigs and cattle.

The virus was discovered in 1960 and got its name because of the villi on its shell, which tend in different directions and resemble a crown. It is known that coronaviruses can cause a number of diseases-from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS or "atypical pneumonia").
